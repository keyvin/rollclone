//Implement items, item pool, dragon den, turn die. 

//Implement a function that implements turn order, then other functions that implement the rules. 


Dragon phase is behaving.. oddly. I need to implement something that causes the phase to skip forward if no monters, items, or dragons.

Still need to implement scrolls.
